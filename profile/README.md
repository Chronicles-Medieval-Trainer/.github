# Chronicles: Medieval Trainer

History is not written in a single stroke. It is layered—day after day—by patience, by timing, by decisions made when the map is quiet and the council chamber cold.
**Chronicles: Medieval** understands this well. Sometimes, though, the weight of waiting grows heavier than the crown itself.

The **Chronicles: Medieval Trainer** is a Windows PC companion built to ease that burden. Not to rewrite history recklessly, but to *guide its tempo*. It offers clarity where there is grind, comfort where there is friction, and control where time would otherwise dictate your fate.

## Overview

This trainer functions as a **real-time, toggle-based gameplay assistant**. Every feature can be enabled or disabled instantly, values can be tuned gently or boldly, and nothing is permanent unless you wish it so.

Its design follows a simple creed:

* Adjust pacing, not purpose
* Assist decisions, not replace them
* Always allow a clean return to vanilla play

Whether you rule as a cautious builder, a relentless warlord, or a curious sandbox historian, the trainer adapts to your reign.

## 🏰 Trainer Feature Highlights

### ⚔️ Combat Comfort
